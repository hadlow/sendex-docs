# Intro to Sendex

## What is Sendex?
Sendex is a lightweight API endpoint testing tool. Save requests as configuration in your API project source and execute requests using the terminal.

### Write requests in YAML
All requests are configured using a YAML config file. Set all the parameters of the request including headers and body in this file.

### Send requests in your terminal
Sending requests is as easy as 1 command in your terminal. Just specify the file and view the response below. Responses are also saved in the sendex folder.

### Config files move with you API versions with Git
Requests stay in sync with your API. Change your request config files as your API endpoints change.
